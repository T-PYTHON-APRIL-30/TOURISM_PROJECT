  The Administrative Hub of Saudi Aramco
  City of Dhahran emerged on the map after the discovery of oil in the region. For over 80 years it has continued to serve as the major administrative hub of the Saudi oil industry. The headquarters of Saudi Aramco are located in Dhahran and over 50,000 employees of the company reside in the city. Employees of Aramco (often called Aramcons), refer to Dhahran as the Aramco Camp. The nearby cities of Khobar and Dammam are known as the areas outside the camp.
